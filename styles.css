   This file holds custom styles that work *with* Tailwind CSS.
   Tailwind handles most of the styling, but this file is for
   small, specific rules, especially for showing/hiding sections.

  By default, all content sections are hidden.

  this rule overrides the one above and makes it visible.

  When the JavaScript adds the 'active' class to a nav link,
  it will turn indigo and become bold.

*/

  gets a darker background and white text.

/* --- Accessibility Helper ---
  This section adds a soft, visible "outline" when you
  use the 'Tab' key to navigate the website. This is
  very helpful for users who can't use a mouse.
  
  Tailwind's 'focus:ring-...' classes do this, but
  this is a good "catch-all" for elements that
  might have missed it.
